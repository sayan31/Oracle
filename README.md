adf-topgear assignment-e description

An application to search for and update employee records in a database. Three-step process using a bounded task flow (a way to encapsulated a reusable portion of an application) and a UI component called a train.
First we’ll implement a search capability, then forward the user to some search results, allowing them to select an employee from the results. When they select an employee, we’ll give them a UI called an ADF Form to edit the employee’s record. Then we’ll give them the ability to either submit the changes or cancel, which on the back end will either commit or rollback the changes to the database. Finally we’ll implement a simple login scenario using a router for validation of a password.
